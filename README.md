## About

A student-managed library for [ESI SBA (École Supérieure en Informatique de Sidi Bel Abbès)](https://www.esi-sba.dz/) hosting lessons, labs, and previous exams.

## Context

At this school, materials and resources are distributed by professors, mostly via email. Unfortunately, this has several issues:

- Some professors only send the materials after the lectures, which is inconvenient for many students.
- Other professors withhold materials until just weeks before the exam sessions, a sort of way to force students to attend lectures.
- The above applies to course materials, labs, exercises, solutions... making it difficult for students to prepare effectively.

In response, some students were kind enough to compile the materials and upload them to a public Google Drive sharing it with their peers. While this helped a ton, it had limitations:

- The resources often remained disorganized.
- They weren't consistently maintained.
- They sometimes became outdated

Octolib is a community-driven initiative that aims to solve the aforementioned problems by providing a centralized hub for all the school's resources that are organized in a consistent format and updated on a yearly basis.

In order to achieve this goal, we rely on contributions from students to keep our resources current and comprehensive. If you'd like to contribute, check out the [CONTRIBUTIONS.md](CONTRIBUTIONS.md)
